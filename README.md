# City Slicker
**Individual Project**

## The Project
City Slicker is a JavaScript Vue application using an [external API](https://developers.teleport.org/api/reference/) and Google Charts to visually display statistics comparing quality of life data of 266 cities worldwide, to help assist people find the cities that best match their needs.

The app provides a drop-down list of cities and a drop-down list of each category. Users can either select a city to retrieve the data specific to that city, or they can select a category to view the top ten cities that maintain the highest scores for that category.
