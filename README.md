# City Slicker
**Individual Project**

## The Project
City Slicker is a JavaScript Vue application using an [external API](https://developers.teleport.org/api/reference/) and Google Charts to visually display statistics comparing quality of life data of 266 cities worldwide, helping people find cities that best match their needs.

The app provides a drop-down list of all cities and  a drop-down list of each category. Users can either select a city to retrieve all data on that specific city, or they can select a category and view the top ten cities with the highest scores for that category.
